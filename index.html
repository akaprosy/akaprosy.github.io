        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Alex Kaprosy. I served in the U.S. Army from September of 1995 to September of 1998. During this time I was assigned to the 3rd FSB(rapid deployment) at Fort Stewart, GA. In 1998, I was deployed for four months to Kuwait under "Operation Desert Thunder". This was when Sadam Hussein kicked the UN Inspectors out of IRAQ. The mission was quickly resolved and changed to intrinsic action.  I returned to my hometown of Federal Way, WA after my contract ended.</p>

          <h2>Civilian Life</h2>
            <p>I have been working for Hydraulex(formerly Hydraulic Repair and Design for 20 years. I've worn many hats durning my time at Hydraulex including hydraulic technician, Technical Sales, Technical Sales Team Lead and Territory Manager(current). I am a Certified Fluid Power Specialist and Certified Fluid Power Electronic Controls Specialist. Us veterans like our badges. I find that the thought process of anaylizing fluid power systems is similiar to coding in that both require algorithmic thinking. After over twenty years of working around maintenance of heavy equipment and trucks, I am ready for a career change and would like to transition web development. I've been building a<a href="https://akaprosy.github.io/psfp.github.io/calculator.html"> website </a>which focuses on hydraulic system design, contamination control and troubleshooting. It is work in progress. </p>
